Assumptions & Understanding:

1) Find the list of maximum satisfaction items/foods
2) No duplicate items/foods can be choosen.
3) In file, first numeric row value will be input of this program.
4) I have considered satisfaction level on below rule
	satisfaction = satisfactionAmount / timeTaken
   if satisfaction is max then it represents maximum satisfaction
5) Input file format like 
	10000 100 -- input row
	16808 250
	50074 659
	..............
   In first row is input row and 10000 is total amount of satisfaction and 100 is number of disks.
   In 2nd row, 16808 is amount of satisfaction and 250 is time taken for disk1 only.
6) File should be located in classpath in said format.
7) Find the total satisfaction amount and list of maximum satisfaction disks.
